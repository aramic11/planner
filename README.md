# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
I had to create a work day planner so that when I enter in a task on the list, itll be saved once I click save. There's also a time block from 9am-5pm which I could add items i need to do. I also had to make the hours a different color depending on if it was present, past or future. I also had to create a local storage to save the texts so they could appear again when I refresh the page. 

In all it was pretty challenging trying to figure out how to do it. At the beginning I couldnt get anything past 12pm to light up as a different color but then I added an if statment to make it work. Also when i tried to click save i would get Object Object pop up everywhere but then I made a few tweaks and it happened to disappear. But it was really nice being able to use third-party APIs to get a ton of work done quickly.
